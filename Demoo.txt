					REACT JS

React is one of the most popular, and powerful open-source JavaScript libraries 
		for building dynamic and interactive user interface

 It is a simple, feature rich and component based UI library

React is developed and released by Facebook

 React develops applications by creating various reusable and independent codes

This UI library is, thus, widely used in web development.

ReactJS can be used to develop small applications as well as big, complex applications.

Facebook is continuously working on the React library and 
	enhancing it by fixing bugs and introducing new features

 React community compliments React library by providing large set of ready-made components to 
		develop web application in a record time

		Better and Faster Performance

		Extremely Flexible 

		Develops Mobile Applications as well

Virtual DOM
DOM stands for Document Object Model. 
It is the most important part of the web as it divides into modules and executes the code.
 Usually, JavaScript Frameworks updates the whole DOM at once, 
which makes the web application slow.

 But react uses virtual DOM which is an exact copy of real DOM.
 Whenever there is a modification in the web application, 
the whole virtual DOM is updated first and finds the difference between real DOM and Virtual DOM.
